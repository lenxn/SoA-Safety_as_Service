Unfortunately there were nowhere experimental results of a heat transfer on a NACA airfoil to be found and therefore the LES method could only be evaluated by comparing with other CFD results.
Accordingly one interesting task for future investigations would be the comparison of the results from this project to experimentally achieved results.

Furthermore it has to be stated that the documentation and reference material for the Large Eddy Simulation is rather meager and it seems that the Ansys Software tool are more dedicated to stationary simulations. Due to the long calculation durations it appears rather cumbersome and errors in the simulation setup can cost a vast amounts of time. Therefore it became obvious that LES requires more experience and knowledge in CFD in order to produce reliable results

Nevertheless there are various reasons to prefer the LES, as stated in chapter \ref{ss:comparison}, and thus it is most likely to become more frequently applied for technical flow investigation in the future.

The Work Package 1 (\textbf{Embedded Systems Architectures}) of the EMC2 project is currently in the first year of a total of three. This signifies that self-driving autonomous vehicles may still be quite a long time ahead, but there are already many abitious projects dealing with this issue. 

Therefore, I personally think, the emerging of this ``new'' technology is just a matter of time.

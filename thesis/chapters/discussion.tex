Most of the concepts and principles feature sin chapter \ref{ch:results} are quite theoretical and based on perceptions which derived from meetings and discussions with experts from this area. Nevertheless, the plausibility and validity cannot be guaranteed. On the one hand this is due to the state of the art of this research area, with few meaningful publications available. On the other hand it is due to the non-disclosure regulations of companies which operate in the functional safety and security area.

However, the document from which most of these concepts originate was created with the aim to demonstrate possible implementations or concepts to the EMC2 project group, since the SoA concept is quite new and unfamiliar to most of the member. Accordingly, they stated the company's way of looking at things with no claim to correctness or completeness. The SoA paradigm for ES like vehicles or aircraft is still quite at the beginning of its development, which is the reason why it is impossible to make any accurate predictions. Hence, the actual purpose, for which use case and other concepts from chapter \ref{ch:results} were developed, namely the creation of a uniform knowledge base, are fulfilled.

This thesis was written as part of the internship at Virtual Vehicle at Inffeldgasse xx from April to July 2015. VV is specialzed in ... and .. . However the functional safety area in which i worked has very similar ``brothers'' in other engineering fields like trains or aviation. 

- da ich daneben and er tu studiere - praktisch
- am ideal match concerning the location as well as the themengebiet.


One of the challenges in the conduction of this project was the location of the necessary hardware, which was at the department's facility. This required a physical attendance at the university for the majority of the work. Also the literature research proved difficult, since there is not yet that much material covering this specific topic.

With regard to this obstacles I am satisfied with the outcome of this project and I hope to provide the reader with a broad overview on the basics of Large Eddy Simulation as well as its advantages and disadvantages.

Thus I want to thank everyone who supported me writing this thesis.

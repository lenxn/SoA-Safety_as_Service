As a result of the first four phases, which are concerned with the conceptual development, the contract is issued. Subsequently follows the actual implementation of the service by a developer, who was (most likely) not included in the preceding design phases. Therefore, the contract must provide all the necessary information for the implementation process, leaving no ambiguities or open questions.

It is then up to the developer to decide how the service is implemented, e.g. which programming language or approach to use. The outcome is a certain architecture, which can be based on arbitrary technologies.
